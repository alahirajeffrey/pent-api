## Project Description
Pent is a hypothetical platform that allows users to post reviews about apartment they have previously lived in as well as reviews about the location, environment and landlords etc. Users can then view these reviews and use to decide to purchase the apartment or not.


## Features
- Authentication and authorization
- Email Verification
- CRUD operations

## Requirements
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Nestjs](https://nestjs.com/) is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Typeorm](https://typeorm.io/) is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications with multiple databases.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
